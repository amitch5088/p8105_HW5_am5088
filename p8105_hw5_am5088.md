load my necessary libraries

## Problem 1

I‚Äôve gone ahead and loaded my necessary libraries and set up plotting
for this problem (tidyverse), and will now start to develop a function
to address the following question:

Suppose you put ùëõpeople in a room, and want to know the probability that
at least two people share a birthday. For simplicity, we‚Äôll assume there
are no leap years (i.e.¬†there are only 365 days) and that birthdays are
uniformly distributed over the year (which is actually not the case).

**Write a function that, for a fixed group size, randomly draws
‚Äúbirthdays‚Äù for each person; checks whether there are duplicate
birthdays in the group; and returns TRUE or FALSE based on the result.**

``` r
shared_birthdays = function(n) {
  
  random_birthdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  return(any(duplicated(random_birthdays)))
}
```

Now I‚Äôm going to test this function:

``` r
shared_birthdays(40)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
shared_birthdays(12)
```

    ## [1] FALSE

Okay, after testing this function, a couple of times it appears that it
is working okay. That is, it is able to produce either TRUE or FALSE
based on the sample size of n people and if there are any duplicated
birthdays in the mix. When I test the function with 40, I get TRUE, and
with 12 people I get FALSE.

**Next, run this function 10000 times for each group size between 2 and
50. For each group size, compute the probability that at least two
people in the group will share a birthday by averaging across the 10000
simulation runs. Make a plot showing the probability as a function of
group size, and comment on your results.**

``` r
results_df = tibble(
  group_size = integer(),
  prob_shared_birthdays = numeric()
)
set.seed
```

Plot my results table

``` r
ggplot(results_df, aes(x = group_size, y = prob_shared_birthdays)) +
geom_line() +
labs(
  title = "Probability of Shared Birthday In Group Size n",
  x = "Group Size",
  y = "Probability of having a Shared Birthday"
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_am5088_files/figure-gfm/plot results table-1.png" width="90%" />

This plot confirms what I learned when I tested the function earlier on
a smaller sample size like 12 which had a FALSE result (indicating a
lower probablity of duplication) vs a larger sample size like 40 which
had a TRUE result (indicating a higher probability of duplication) which
is what the plot shows. As the group size increases, the probability of
people having a shared birthday increases which is why live in a world
with a huge sample size (if we could sample the whole world) and a lot
of duplicated birthdays across the 365 days we count in Western society.
On the other hand in my group of close friends which is less than 10,
there are no duplicated birthdays because that probability is lower in a
smaller sample.

## Problem 2

When designing an experiment or analysis, a common question is whether
it is likely that a true effect will be detected ‚Äì put differently,
whether a false null hypothesis will be rejected. The probability that a
false null hypothesis is rejected is referred to as power, and it
depends on several factors, including: the sample size; the effect size;
and the error variance. In this problem, you will conduct a simulation
to explore power in a one-sample t-test.

``` r
sim_t_test = function(mu, n = 30, sigma = 5, num_sim = 5000) {
  replicate(num_sim, {
  x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
    
  t_test = t.test(x, mu = 0)
    
  broom::tidy(t_test)
  }, simplify = FALSE) %>% 
    bind_rows() %>% 
    mutate(true_mu = mu)
}
```

Repeat the above for ùúá={1,2,3,4,5,6} and complete the following:

Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the
power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of ùúá on the x axis.
Describe the association between effect size and power. Make a plot
showing the average estimate of ùúáÃÇ on the y axis and the true value of ùúá
on the x axis. Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average
estimate of ùúáÃÇ only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y
axis and the true value of ùúá on the x axis. Is the sample average of ùúáÃÇ
across tests for which the null is rejected approximately equal to the
true value of ùúá ? Why or why not?

``` r
repeat_mu_values = 0:6

repeat_mu_df = map_dfr(repeat_mu_values, ~ sim_t_test(mu = .x))
```

plot showing proportion of times null was rejected (power)

``` r
mu_hat_df = repeat_mu_df %>%
group_by(true_mu) %>%
  summarize(
    power = mean(p.value < 0.05),
    avg_mu_hat = mean(estimate),
    avg_mu_hat_rejected = mean(estimate[p.value < 0.05])
  )

ggplot(mu_hat_df, aes(x = true_mu, y = power)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
  title = "Power of the T-Test by true Œº",
  x = "True Œº",
  y = "# of null rejections"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_am5088_files/figure-gfm/plot null rejection frequency-1.png" width="90%" />
It appears that as the power (proportion of rejections of the null
hypothesis) of this test increases, so does the true value of Œº.

Plot 2:

``` r
ggplot(mu_hat_df, aes(x = true_mu)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_mu_hat, color = "All Samples")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_mu_hat_rejected, color = "Rejected Null")) +
  labs(
  title = "Average Estimate of ŒºÃÇ by True Œº",
  x = "True Œº",
  y = "Average ŒºÃÇ") +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("All Samples" = "green", "Rejected Null" = "blue"),
    name = "Condition"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_am5088_files/figure-gfm/plot 2-1.png" width="90%" />

Is the sample average of ùúáÃÇ across tests for which the null is rejected
approximately equal to the true value of ùúá? Why or why not?

No, it doesn‚Äôt appear from the graph that the sample average Œº(hat)
across tests for which the null is rejected is approximately equal to
the true value of Œº. Instead, it appears that the sample average of Œº
(hat) across the power (null rejected) is a bit larger than the true
value of Œº.

## Problem 3

The Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S.
cities and made the data available through a GitHub repository here. You
can read their accompanying article here.

Describe the raw data. Create a city_state variable (e.g.¬†‚ÄúBaltimore,
MD‚Äù) and then summarize within cities to obtain the total number of
homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the
disposition is ‚ÄúClosed without arrest‚Äù or ‚ÄúOpen/No arrest‚Äù).

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)

wpost_homicide_data = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")
```

The raw data has 52,179 rows and 12 variables including victim first and
last name, race, age, sex, and then location variables such as city,
state, exact location (lat, lon) and disposition which appears to be how
the case was handled. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a lot of missing data.

merge variables city and state into one variable

``` r
wpost_homicide_data = wpost_homicide_data %>%
mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state))
```

summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the
number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is ‚ÄúClosed
without arrest‚Äù or ‚ÄúOpen/No arrest‚Äù).

``` r
city_data_summary = wpost_homicide_data %>%
  mutate(
  unsolved = disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest")
  ) %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(
    total_homicides = n(),
    unsolved_homicides = sum(unsolved)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```
